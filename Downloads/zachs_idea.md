## Blog Posts 

Users will be able to create and maintain their own blog within our platform if they wish to do so. Such as being able to create new blog posts.

### Implementation

To implement this feature we will use some form of headless content management system(CMS) to allow users to easily upload and edit blog posts.

### What is a CMS

A CMS is a type of software that helps in the creation and modification of digital content. A popular example of a CMS would be WordPress.

### What is a Headless CMS

A headless CMS is a form of CMS that doesn't come with a built in frontend. It acts primarily as a backend repository that serves your content 
as data over an API. This allows for freedom of design and ability to serve data to multiple different platforms. 

### Potential CMS 

- Strapi 
- Ghost

Might potentially create our own implementation of a CMS so we don't have to rely on a third party and make changes based on user feedback.
